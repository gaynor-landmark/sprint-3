Responsive Web Design (RWD)

Summary:  Responsive Design Teams create a single site to support many devices, but need to consider content, design and performance across devices to ensure usability.

Responsive design is achieved by the use of Breakpoints - the designed used is dependent on Browser width.  The same HTML is served, but the CSS changes the appearance of the page.  Responsive design relys on proportion based grids to rearrange (or hide) content and design elements.

Advantages :
  1. Faster to develop as there is only one code base.
  2. Easier to maintain as there is only one code base.
  3. The ability to add new breakpoints later aids 'future-proofing'.
  4. Especially good for sites focussed on content.

Disadvantages :
  1. It is difficult to split complex data.
  2. A useable design for all devices requires the dev and designer to work closely together.  More work at design time.
  3. Server returns the same HTML to all devices, even if it is not needed.  This can result in slow page rendering.

Bootstrap is a responsive design framework.

Remember to conduct usability test across ALL platorms and devices.

Content Prioritzation is very important.
Mobile devices should be a 'first thought' not an 'after thought'.
The Homepage is a high priority page - goals and culture should be there on all devices.
Don't downgrade design just to gain consistency across devices.
Small devices require elegant navigation.
Consider a light version for fast download on mobile devices.

Consider Performance -
Users have limited memory and attention, and like to feel in control.  A snappy experience beats a glamorous one, as users will engage more.

Response-Time Limits -
0.1sec - feels instantaneous
1 sec  - flow of thought is seamless
<10sec - abble to keep attention although users wish it was faster
>10sec - users leave the site - too hard to keep their brains on track.
