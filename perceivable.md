Perceivable

From these readings, it is clear that laziness is the enemy of accessability.  In my mind there is no-longer any excuse for not structuring your html correctly and adding headings, titles etc. and clearly separating your styling with css, so that your web pages can be easily transformed for assistive technology.  TRANSFORMABILITY would be the key word here.  This will definitely influence the way I work.  I've always been pedantic - now I have a good reason to be.  :-)  

The only other thing I thought about (read elsewhere, but not in this section) is the importance of clearly labelling an element that has been used in a non-standard way.
