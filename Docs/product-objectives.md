The Product

Polar-Walks - a walking tour of the central area of Palmerston North, captured in polaroid photos, taken by the walker. 
(Based on a similar styled walking tour in Vienna).
The 'walker' is lent a polaroid camera with 10 shots loaded.  After a short introduction to photography using an instant camera, they will head out on a guided tour of the area.  The walker will document their experience in interesting photos, before heading back to a cafe for a hot drink and an opportunity to share their them with the other 'walkers'. 

The Polar-Walks Website

This will be the main way that 'walkers' find the tours and book a place in a tour or contact a tour guide to arrange a tour.  It will sell the experience to potential 'walkers', and provide a place for 'walkers' to display their favourite photos.
